Who We Were, and where we went.

On Novemeber, 21st. Our team was purged due to unresolved matters involving the improvement of many factors including, LUA Script Circulation, Engagement rate, Usage factors, and overall more success for this thing called Aimware. After fighting countless times trying to improve a dead/broken/unbuilt release of V6 we wanted to give up. But we never did! In fact we wanted to help it even more! Our team consists of Beta Testers. This gave us access to a private server allowing us to create suggestions, submit bug reports / crash reports, and more. But in the end no one saw our future of trying to improve these factors I've listed previously. All of the Beta Team just thought about Rage this, Rage that, Rage everything, never once was it about improving lua, improving the overall playerbase of the cheat, or just trying to simply help people asking for help. In my eyes in order to become friends with one of these people you have to consistently say the n-word, your sentences always had to involve a certain race, etc.

We were banned for trying to help Aimware. And just like all the other previous beta testers we get banned for essentially uncovering the blanket of racism that this cheat is bounded by.

Coming soon we are releasing something no one has ever seen. Leagues above Aimware in their own framework. Stay Tuned.

Next month would've marked 10 years on Aimware for me. It's quite unfortunate it had to end this way for no reason.
